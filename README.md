## Procto Frontend Development Task
I have completed the Procto frontend development task by taking inspiration from the Parul University website. The task required the creation of a simple webpage with the following components: a header, navigation bar, main content area, and a footer. Additionally, I applied CSS styling to make the webpage visually appealing and ensured that it is responsive.

## Key Highlights:
- Designed and implemented a simple webpage inspired by Parul University.
- Created a responsive layout for optimal viewing on various devices.
- Utilized CSS for enhanced visual aesthetics.
- Demonstrated web design skills by replicating the webpage in Figma.

Feel free to explore the code and design in this repository to assess my skills in frontend development and web design. Your feedback is highly appreciated!
